Subsonic, fixed-wing aircraft. Jet, and propeller propulsion systems. 
Rigid aircraft assumption, but this will be addressed in future releases.

control, numpy, matplotlib, pip, scipy, avlwrapper. Will need a LaTex compiler to edit documentation.
Will need to add avl.exe to $PATH. A copy of avl.exe is included in this repository.

# To-Do
Add tests for aircraft class.
Add constraint analysis.
Add aircraft structure weight estimates.
Add FEA and FTR ratio to aero model.
